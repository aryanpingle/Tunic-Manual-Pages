# Pages of TUNIC's Instruction Manual

This is a collection of all pages of the instruction manual from the video game, [_TUNIC_](https://tunicgame.com/).

The directory structure is as follows:

```
pages
â”œâ”€â”€ high-quality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ original
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ translated-clean
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ translated-raw
â””â”€â”€ low-quality
    â”œâ”€â”€ original
    â”œâ”€â”€ translated-clean
    â””â”€â”€ translated-raw
```

- Each page is a JPEG image contained in the directories given above.
- Each image filename corresponds to the page's number - `0.jpg` is the manual cover, `1.jpg` is page 1, etc.
- `high`/`low` quality refers to the combination of size and JPEG compression of each image.
- Each page is available in 3 forms:
    - `original` means the page is written in _TUNIC_'s language (unofficially dubbed "Runic") and looks like it would in-game.
    - `translated-raw` means the page has been translated to English in a way that keeps every English word in front of its sequence of Runic symbols.
    - `translated-clean` means the page has been fully translated to English in neat paragraphs.

## Disclaimer

I'm not a lawyer so I don't know how to write this, but here goes:

_TUNIC_ and all its assets belong to Andrew Shouldice (ðŸ‘‘) and Finji Games. Pages (original and translated) have been sourced from [book.tunic.wiki](https://book.tunic.wiki/). I (Aryan Pingle) (maintainer of this repository) **DO NOT OWN** any part of the game; I am simply in love with this game and want to help fellow developers and enthusiasts to make cool stuff using the pages of TUNIC's in-game instruction manual.

Please don't sue me.
